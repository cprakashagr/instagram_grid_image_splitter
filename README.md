# Instagram Image Splitter for its Grid

```python
Usages: python makeGrid.py xAxis(columns) yAxis(rows) inputImage
```

### Notes:
Assumption: The input image is already in square format. Preferrably - 700x multiplier pixels.
Not intending to maintain it any further - this was done for completely personal use. :)
